# RIP Quick Add

Quickly create Google Calendar events from plain text.

[Quick Add][article] was a Google Calendar feature that existed from 2012–[2017][rip] that enabled creating calendar events from natural language text input. I loved it and they deprecated it from me ☹️. This is my attempt to carry on its legacy. It uses the [Chrono][chrono] library to extract time data from text.

## How it works

1. Takes a text input,
2. parses the input to find date info, and then
3. returns a Google Calendar URL for adding the event to your calendar.

## Usage

### Chrome Extension
Install the Chrome extension from [Chrome Web Store][webstore].

### Chrome Search Engine

Adding `https://timkovi.ch/rip_quick_add_api?text=%s` as a search engine in Chrome will allow you to create calendar events from the address bar.

### Web App
Alternatively, I have a running implementation [on my website][max].

#### Local
If you want to run the webapp locally:

```
yarn install
yarn start
```

## Documentation

The "API" this app is using is documented [here][docs].
